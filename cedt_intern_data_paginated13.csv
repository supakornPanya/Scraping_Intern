Responsibilities include creating terrains, obstacles, lighting setups, and sensor-enabled environments using Isaac Sim or similar tools. Interns will learn how to structure simulation assets into reusable modules and design scenes that reflect real-world constraints such as uneven ground, cluttered spaces, or dynamic elements. These simulation pipelines will be foundational for training and testing spatial AI systems.</p><p><em><u>	</u></em><strong><em><u>Tools: </u></em></strong><em><u>Isaac Sim, Python, FreeCAD</u></em></p><p>&nbsp;</p><h1><strong><em>Task 2 — Robot Configuration Pipeline (2 seats)</em></strong></h1><p>Interns will work on robot model configuration and preparation inside simulation. This includes editing URDF files, adjusting joint limits and inertial parameters, integrating sensors, and tuning articulation properties for humanoids and quadrupeds. Interns will build observation/action spaces for reinforcement learning, validate locomotion stability, and ensure each robot’s configuration is compatible with downstream control or RL pipelines. This task bridges robot modeling with behavior learning.</p><p><strong><em><u>Tools: </u></em></strong><em><u>URDF/Xacro, FreeCAD, Isaac Sim, ROS2 URDF tools</u></em></p><p>&nbsp;</p><h1><strong><em>Task 3 — Search &amp; Exploration Mission (2 seats)</em></strong></h1><p>Interns will design and implement autonomous search, mapping, and exploration behaviors for rescue, wildfire, and hazardous-area scenarios. Using LiDAR, thermal imaging, and SLAM techniques, interns will build algorithms for frontier exploration, anomaly detection, and mission sequencing. Robots must be able to navigate unstructured terrain and relay mission-critical information through dashboards. This task exposes interns to practical robotic autonomy in challenging environments.</p><p><strong>Tools: </strong>ROS2, Cartographer/FAST-LIO, LiDAR SDKs (Ouster), Nav2, Isaac Sim</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h1><strong><em>Task 4 — Dashboard &amp; Mission Control (2 seats)</em></strong></h1><p>Interns will create real-time mission control dashboards for robot monitoring and remote operation. Responsibilities include building web-based interfaces that display ROS2 data, visualizing robot states through RViz-style components, and implementing command interfaces for navigation or mission execution. The focus is on usability, responsiveness, and clean integration with robotic middleware. Interns gain valuable experience in human-robot interaction tools and real-time systems.</p><p><strong><em><u>Tools: </u></em></strong><em><u>ROS2, RVizWeb, WebSockets, Docker</u></em></p><p>&nbsp;</p><h1><strong><em>Task 5 — ROS Node for Customized Humanoid (2 seats)</em></strong></h1><p>Interns will develop ROS/ROS2 nodes specifically for a customized humanoid robot. Tasks include implementing modules for joint actuation, sensor streaming, IMU filtering, foot contact estimation, and high-level control services. Interns will construct publishers, subscribers, action servers, and TF frames required for seamless operation between simulation, control systems, and web-based dashboards. This role provides direct experience in robotics middleware and real-time humanoid control structure design.</p><p><strong><em><u>Tools: </u></em></strong><em><u>ROS2 Humble, Isaac Sim ROS BridgeRViz, TF</u></em></p><p>&nbsp;</p><h1><strong><em>Task 6 — OpenVLA Pipeline (2 seats)</em></strong></h1><p>Interns will integrate and experiment with Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models to enable robots to interpret natural-language instructions and visual inputs. Work involves connecting perception modules, tokenizer pipelines, and action generators within the OpenVLA ecosystem. Interns will test model behavior, tune input structures, and build simple VLA-driven behaviors in simulation. This task places interns at the frontier of embodied AI research.</p><p><strong><em><u>Tools: </u></em></strong><em><u>OpenVLA, PyTorch, Isaac Sim, Python</u></em></p><p>&nbsp;</p><h1><strong><em>Task 7 — VLA Data Collection Pipeline (2 seats)</em></strong></h1><p>Interns will construct multimodal data pipelines for training Vision-Language-Action systems. Responsibilities include capturing task demonstrations, recording robot telemetry, labeling sequences, and generating clean language annotations. Interns will prepare structured datasets—combining images, video, action traces, and text—in formats suitable for VLA models. This role emphasizes dataset quality, consistency, and scalable data-generation workflows.</p><p><strong><em><u>Tools: </u></em></strong><em><u>OpenCV, FFmpeg, HuggingFace Datasets</u></em></p>",https://cedtintern.cp.eng.chula.ac.th/api/sessions/5/openings?search=&page=7&limit=20&onlyBookmarked=false&onlyAvailablePositions=false
